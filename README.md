# Analysis of lizards behavioral data

This post includes the computational details acompanying the article entitled "The mechanistic basis of behavioral thermoregulation in lizards: A reciprocal transplant experiment along an elevational gradient," currently under internal review.  The lead author is Jeanine M. Refsnider. The contents will be updated when the manuscript is submitted.
 
In response to reviewer comments, additional analysis was added to compare the behavior of lizards when they were sunning (under full sun). The same model was used to the subset of data to compare the full sun timing (morning, afternoon, or evening).
